Changelog
=========

1.3
---

- Prevent users from adding an invalid function to the graph. Show an
  error and ask them to re-enter the function.

- use single quotes when adding equations to dropdown list since double
  quotes don't work on Chrome.
    
- use regexp syntax for string replacement since the global match flag
  (eg s.replace(substr, newsubstr, 'g') is not supported by Chrome.


1.2
---

- use span rather than div as container to allow inline display of
  graphs

- Embed svg source in hidden CDATA section alongside ASCIISvg script.
  NOTE: Plone 3's safe_html transform swallows CDATA, Plone 4 works
  correctly.
