Introduction
============

A TinyMCE plugin for Plone to render a function of a graph as SVG.

It is based on the TinyMCE plugin written by David Lippman as part of
the IMathAS project: http://www.imathas.com/. A demo of the IMathAS
version of the plugin is available here:
http://www.imathas.com/editordemo/demo.html

For FullMarks (and Plone), the plugin has been modified to always render
SVG and not use any fallbacks that generate images server-side.

Additionally it uses the latest version (ver 2.0) of the ASCIIMATH
javascript library by Peter Jipsen available here:
